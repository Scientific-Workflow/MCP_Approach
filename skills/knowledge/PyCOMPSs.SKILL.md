# API

PyCOMPSs provides an API for data synchronization and other functionalities, such as task group definition and automatic function parameter synchronization (local decorator).

## Synchronization

The main program of the application is a sequential code that contains calls to the selected tasks. In addition, when synchronizing for task data from the main program, there exist six API functions that can be invoked:

### `compss_open(file_name, mode=’r’)`

Similar to the Python `open()` call. It synchronizes for the last version of file `file_name` and returns the file descriptor for that synchronized file. It can have an optional parameter `mode`, which defaults to `‘r‘`, containing the mode in which the file will be opened (the open modes are analogous to those of Python `open()`).

### `compss_wait_on_file(*file_name)`

Synchronizes for the last version of the file/s specified by `file_name`. Returns `True` if success (`False` otherwise).

### `compss_wait_on_directory(*directory_name)`

Synchronizes for the last version of the directory or directories specified by `directory_name` Returns `True` if success (`False` otherwise).

### `compss_barrier(no_more_tasks=False)`

Performs a explicit synchronization, but does not return any object. The use of `compss_barrier()` forces to wait for all tasks that have been submitted before the `compss_barrier()` is called. When all tasks submitted before the `compss_barrier()` have finished, the execution continues. The `no_more_tasks` is used to specify if no more tasks are going to be submitted after the `compss_barrier()`.

### `compss_barrier_group(group_name)`

Performs a explicit synchronization over the tasks that belong to the group `group_name`, but does not return any object. The use of `compss_barrier_group()` forces to wait for all tasks that belong to the given group submitted before the `compss_barrier_group()` is called. When all group tasks submitted before the `compss_barrier_group()` have finished, the execution continues. See Task Groups for more information about task groups.

### `compss_wait_on(*obj, mode=”r” | “rw”)`

Synchronizes for the last version of object/s specified by `obj` and returns the synchronized object. It can have an optional string parameter `mode`, which defaults to `rw`, that indicates whether the main program will modify the returned object. It is possible to wait on a list of objects. In this particular case, it will synchronize all future objects contained in the list recursively.

To illustrate the use of the aforementioned API functions, the following example (Code 133) first invokes a task `func` that writes a file, which is later synchronized by calling `compss_open()`. Later in the program, an object of class `MyClass` is created and a task method `method` that modifies the object is invoked on it; the object is then synchronized with `compss_wait_on`, so that it can be used in the main program from that point on.

Then, a loop calls again ten times to `func` task. Afterwards, the `compss_barrier()` call performs a synchronization, and the execution of the main user code will not continue until the ten `func` tasks have finished. This call does not retrieve any information.

### Code 133 PyCOMPSs Synchronization API functions usage

```python
from pycompss.api.api import compss_open
from pycompss.api.api import compss_wait_on
from pycompss.api.api import compss_wait_on_file
from pycompss.api.api import compss_wait_on_directory
from pycompss.api.api import compss_barrier

if __name__=='__main__':
    my_file = 'file.txt'
    func(my_file)
    fd = compss_open(my_file)
    ...

    my_file2 = 'file2.txt'
    func(my_file2)
    compss_wait_on_file(my_file2)
    ...

    my_directory = '/tmp/data'
    func_dir(my_directory)
    compss_wait_on_directory(my_directory)
    ...

    my_obj2 = MyClass()
    my_obj2.method()
    my_obj2 = compss_wait_on(my_obj2)
    ...

    for i in range(10):
        func(str(i) + my_file)
    compss_barrier()
    ...
```

The corresponding task definition for the example above would be (Code 134):

### Code 134 PyCOMPSs Synchronization API usage tasks

```python
@task(f=FILE_OUT)
def func(f):
    ...

class MyClass(object):
    ...

    @task()
    def method(self):
        ... # self is modified here
```

> **Tip**
>
> It is possible to synchronize a list of objects. This is particularly useful when the programmer expect to synchronize more than one elements (using the `compss_wait_on` function) (Code 135). This feature also works with dictionaries, where the value of each entry is synchronized. In addition, if the structure synchronized is a combination of lists and dictionaries, the `compss_wait_on` will look for all objects to be synchronized in the whole structure.

### Code 135 Synchronization of a list of objects

```python
if __name__=='__main__':
    # l is a list of objects where some/all of them may be future objects
    l = []
    for i in range(10):
        l.append(ret_func())

    ...

    l = compss_wait_on(l)
```

> **Important**

> In order to make the COMPSs Python binding function correctly, the programmer should not use relative imports in the code. Relative imports can lead to ambiguous code and they are discouraged in Python, as explained in: http://docs.python.org/2/faq/programming.html#what-are-the-best-practices-for-using-import-in-a-module

## Local Decorator

Besides the synchronization API functions, the programmer has also a decorator for automatic function parameters synchronization at his disposal. The `@local` decorator can be placed over functions that are not decorated as tasks, but that may receive results from tasks (Code 136). In this case, the `@local` decorator synchronizes the necessary parameters in order to continue with the function execution without the need of using explicitly the `compss_wait_on` call for each parameter.

### Code 136 @local decorator example

```python
from pycompss.api.task import task
from pycompss.api.api import compss_wait_on
from pycompss.api.parameter import INOUT
from pycompss.api.local import local

@task(v=INOUT)
def append_three_ones(v):
    v += [1, 1, 1]

@local
def scale_vector(v, k):
    return [k*x for x in v]

if __name__=='__main__':
    v = [1,2,3]
    append_three_ones(v)
    # v is automatically synchronized when calling the scale_vector function.
    w = scale_vector(v, 2)
```

## File/Object deletion

PyCOMPSs also provides two functions within its API for object/file deletion. These calls allow the runtime to clean the infrastructure explicitly, but the deletion of the objects/files will be performed as soon as the objects/files dependencies are released.

### `compss_delete_file(*file_name)`

Notifies the runtime to delete a file/s.

### `compss_delete_object(*object)`

Notifies the runtime to delete all the associated files to a given object/s.

> **Warning**
>
> It does not support collections.

The following example (Code 137) illustrates the use of the aforementioned API functions.

### Code 137 PyCOMPSs delete API functions usage

```python
from pycompss.api.api import compss_delete_file
from pycompss.api.api import compss_delete_object

if __name__=='__main__':
    my_file = 'file.txt'
    func(my_file)
    compss_delete_file(my_file)
    ...

    my_obj = MyClass()
    my_obj.method()
    compss_delete_object(my_obj)
    ...
```

The corresponding task definition for the example above would be (Code 138):

### Code 138 PyCOMPSs delete API usage tasks

```python
@task(f=FILE_OUT)
def func(f):
    ...

class MyClass(object):
    ...

    @task()
    def method(self):
        ... # self is modified here
```

## Task Groups

COMPSs also enables to specify task groups. To this end, COMPSs provides the `TaskGroup` context (Code 139) which can be tuned with the group name, and a second parameter (boolean) to perform an implicit barrier for the whole group. Users can also define task groups within task groups.

### `TaskGroup(group_name, implicit_barrier=True)`

Python context to define a group of tasks. All tasks submitted within the context will belong to `group_name` context and are sensitive to wait for them while the rest are being executed. Tasks groups are depicted within a box into the generated task dependency graph.

### Code 139 PyCOMPSs Task group definition

```python
from pycompss.api.task import task
from pycompss.api.api import TaskGroup
from pycompss.api.api import compss_barrier_group

@task()
def func1():
    ...

@task()
def func2():
    ...

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Creation of group
    with TaskGroup('Group1', False):
        for i in range(NUM_TASKS):
            func1()
            func2()
        ...
    ...
    compss_barrier_group('Group1')
    ...
```

### `compss_barrier_group(group_name)`

Task Groups are commonly used to implement the exception mechanism in PyCOMPSs applications (see `@on_failure` section for more information about this feature.). Moreover, developers can also cancel task groups using the `compss_cancel_group` API call, indicating the name of the group to cancel as depicted in (Code 140).

### Code 140 PyCOMPSs Task group cancellation

```python
from pycompss.api.task import task
from pycompss.api.api import TaskGroup
from pycompss.api.api import compss_cancel_group

@task()
def func1():
    ...

@task()
def func2():
    ...

if __name__=='__main__':
    # Creation of group
    with TaskGroup('Group1', False):
        for i in range(NUM_TASKS):
            func1()
            func2()
        ...
    ...
    compss_cancel_group('Group1')
    ...
```

## Other

PyCOMPSs also provides other function within its API to check if a file exists.

### `compss_file_exists(*file_name)`

Checks if a file or files exist. If it does not exist, the function checks if the file has been accessed before by calling the runtime.

Code 141 illustrates its usage.

### Code 141 PyCOMPSs API file exists usage

```python
from pycompss.api.api import compss_file_exists

if __name__=='__main__':
    my_file = 'file.txt'
    func(my_file)
    if compss_file_exists(my_file):
        print("Exists")
    else:
        print("Not exists")
    ...
```

The corresponding task definition for the example above would be (Code 142):

### Code 142 PyCOMPSs delete API usage tasks

```python
@task(f=FILE_OUT)
def func(f):
    ...
```
