&#x20; **Brief summary of what this skill enables the agent to do. Include WHEN to trigger it —**

&#x20; **list specific user phrases, contexts, and task types. Be slightly "pushy" to avoid**

&#x20; **undertriggering: e.g., "Use this skill whenever the user mentions X, Y, or Z, even**

&#x20; **if they don't explicitly ask for it."**

**One-sentence summary of what this skill does and why it exists.**



**---**



**## When to Use This Skill**



**Use this skill when the user:**

**- Trigger condition 1 (e.g., asks to generate a specific type of file or artifact)**

**- Trigger condition 2 (e.g., mentions a specific tool, library, or framework)**

**- Trigger condition 3 (e.g., wants to perform a multi-step task in a codebase)**



**Do NOT use this skill when:**

**- Anti-trigger 1 (e.g., this skill file is used to provide workflow context and the user is requesting for code generation)**

**- Anti-trigger 2 (e.g., the specified scientific workflow involves PARSL -- use the PARSL skill instead)**



**---**



**## Overview**



**Short description of the workflow this skill enables. Explain the high-level approach**

**in 2-4 sentences.**



**\*\*Dependencies:\*\* List any tools, packages, or CLIs needed (e.g., `ripgrep`, `jq`, `python3`).**



**---**



**## Step-by-Step Workflow**

**### Note: This section has no limit to the steps it can contain. This three step example is not the maximum or minimum amount of steps required.**

**### Step 1: \[First Action]**



**Describe what to do first. Be explicit — name the tool, the path, and the expected result.**



**```bash**

**# Example: reading an uploaded file**

**cat /mnt/user-data/uploads/input.csv | head -20**

**```**



**\*\*Few-shot:\*\***

**- Input: user says "process my sales data" with a file uploaded**

**- Action: run `ls /mnt/user-data/uploads/` to confirm the file exists, then inspect it**

**- Output: a brief summary of what the file contains before proceeding**



**### Step 2: \[Second Action]**



**Describe the next step with a concrete example of what correct behavior looks like.**



**```python**

**# Example: a transformation the agent might apply**

**import pandas as pd**

**df = pd.read\_csv("/mnt/user-data/uploads/input.csv")**

**result = df.groupby("category").sum()**

**result.to\_csv("/mnt/user-data/outputs/summary.csv", index=False)**

**```**



**\*\*Few-shot:\*\***

**- Input: a CSV with columns `date`, `category`, `amount`**

**- Action: group by `category`, sum `amount`, write result to outputs/**

**- Output: `summary.csv` saved to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`**



**### Step 3: \[Third Action]**



**Continue through the workflow. Include any validation step before finalizing output.**



**\*\*Few-shot:\*\***

**- Before writing output: confirm the result has the expected shape (e.g., row count, columns)**

**- If validation fails: surface the issue to the user with a plain-language explanation**

**- If validation passes: write the file and call `present\_files` (if available in context)**



**---**



**## Input / Output**



**\*\*Input:\*\* Describe what the agent receives — file paths, user instructions, structured data, etc.**



**\*\*Output:\*\* Describe what the agent produces — file type, naming convention, directory.**



**\*\*Output path:\*\* `/mnt/user-data/outputs/<descriptive-filename>.<ext>`**



**### Few-Shot I/O Examples**



**\*\*Example A — File transform:\*\***

**- Input: `/mnt/user-data/uploads/data.xlsx`**

**- Output: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/data\_cleaned.csv`**



**\*\*Example B — Code generation:\*\***

**- Input: user describes a module they want**

**- Output: new file written to the project directory, e.g., `src/utils/parser.py`**



**\*\*Example C — Multi-file output:\*\***

**- Input: a directory of `.md` files**

**- Output: a single compiled `report.pdf` in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`**



**---**



**## Key Rules and Constraints**



**- \*\*Always\*\* do X before proceeding to step Y (e.g., validate input format before transforming)**

**- \*\*Never\*\* overwrite the original uploaded file — always write to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`**

**- \*\*Format constraint:\*\* output must conform to \[schema / structure / naming convention]**

**- \*\*Error handling:\*\* if a step fails, explain what went wrong plainly before retrying or stopping**



**### Few-Shot Constraint Examples**



**| Situation | Correct behavior | Incorrect behavior |**

**|---|---|---|**

**| Input file is missing | Tell the user and stop | Silently create an empty output |**

**| Output would overwrite existing file | Append a suffix (e.g., `\_v2`) | Overwrite without warning |**

**| Ambiguous instruction | Ask one targeted clarifying question | Guess and proceed silently |**

**| Dependency not installed | Run `pip install X --break-system-packages` | Fail with a raw traceback |**



**---**



**## Examples**



**### Example 1: \[Happy Path — Simple Case]**



**\*\*User says:\*\* "Summarize the data in my uploaded CSV."**



**\*\*Agent does:\*\***

**1. Runs `ls /mnt/user-data/uploads/` to find the file**

**2. Reads a sample with `head` to understand structure**

**3. Writes a Python script to compute summary stats**

**4. Saves output to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/summary.txt`**

**5. Reports the result inline with key findings**



**\*\*Expected output snippet:\*\***

**```**

**Rows: 1,204**

**Columns: date, region, revenue**

**Revenue range: $412 – $98,430**

**Top region: Northeast ($1.2M total)**

**```**



**---**



**### Example 2: \[Edge Case — Malformed Input]**



**\*\*User says:\*\* "Parse this JSON config and generate a scaffold."**



**\*\*Agent does:\*\***

**1. Reads the file — finds it is not valid JSON**

**2. Reports: "The file has a syntax error on line 14 — missing closing bracket. Please fix and re-upload."**

**3. Does NOT attempt to proceed or guess at intent**



**---**



**### Example 3: \[Ambiguous Intent]**



**\*\*User says:\*\* "Clean up my project."**



**\*\*Agent does:\*\***

**1. Recognizes this is ambiguous — "clean up" could mean formatting, dead code removal, dependency pruning, etc.**

**2. Asks: "Do you mean auto-format the code, remove unused imports, or something else?"**

**3. Waits for clarification before running any tool**



**---**



**## Edge Cases**



**- \*\*Missing file:\*\* If `/mnt/user-data/uploads/` is empty or the expected file isn't there, ask the user to re-upload rather than proceeding**

**- \*\*Unsupported format:\*\* If the input is a file type not covered by this skill, say so clearly and suggest the appropriate skill or tool**

**- \*\*Large file:\*\* If the file exceeds reasonable in-memory limits, process it in chunks or stream it**

**- \*\*Conflicting instructions:\*\* If the user's request contradicts a constraint in this skill, surface the conflict and ask which takes priority**


**## Notes**



**- \*\*Claude Code specifics:\*\* This skill assumes access to `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, and `Edit` tools. If running in a restricted environment, fall back to \[alternative approach].**

**- \*\*Package installs:\*\* Always use `pip install <pkg> --break-system-packages` in the Claude Code sandbox.**

**- \*\*Gotcha:\*\* \[Known failure mode and how to avoid it]**

**- \*\*Version note:\*\* \[Any behavior that differs across versions of a dependency]**
